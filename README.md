 Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a resource or perform an action. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be.The primary purpose of authentication is to secure access to a system or application by confirming the user's identity. It typically involves providing a set of credentials, such as a username and password or other authentication methods (e.g., biometrics, two-factor authentication) to prove identity.Authentication is a term that refers to the process of proving that some fact or some document is genuine. In computer science, this term is typically associated with proving a user's identity.

Login "login" authentication, in the most simple words, is the way of confirming the identity of a user while they access their profile on a particular platform. We all have been using passwords for years to prove our identity on various platforms to access specific resources or information.

For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have roles like "Admin," "User," and "Guest," each with different levels of access.
