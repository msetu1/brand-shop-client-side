#### authentication:
 Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity attempting to access a resource or perform an action. It ensures that the user is who they claim to be.The primary purpose of authentication is to secure access to a system or application by confirming the user's identity. It typically involves providing a set of credentials, such as a username and password or other authentication methods (e.g., biometrics, two-factor authentication) to prove identity.Authentication is a term that refers to the process of proving that some fact or some document is genuine. In computer science, this term is typically associated with proving a user's identity.


#### Login:
Login "login" authentication, in the most simple words, is the way of confirming the identity of a user while they access their profile on a particular platform. We all have been using passwords for years to prove our identity on various platforms to access specific resources or information.


#### Register:
To "register" means creating a new user account, that is a record in the database describing how you will prove your identity. To authenticate you means providing evidence that your identity matches the one described in your user account.

#### Private Route :
Private routes are parts of your application that are only accessible to authenticated users. You can use route guards or middleware to check if a user is authenticated before allowing them to access these routes.("add Product")To add a product to your e-commerce platform, you typically need to be an admin or a user with the appropriate permission.
Create a private route that is accessible only to users with the "Admin" role or a specific permission for adding products.("details") A product details page can be a public route accessible to all users or a private route depending on your application's design.
For private product details, ensure that users can only view details if they are authenticated, but it doesn't necessarily require specific permissions beyond authentication.("update") Editing or updating a product is typically a privileged action and should be protected.
Create a private route or interface accessible only to users with "Admin" or "Product Manager" roles or a specific permission to edit products. ("my cart") Depending on your application, you may have different user roles or permissions. These permissions define what actions a user can perform. For example, in an e-commerce application, you might have roles like "Admin," "User," and "Guest," each with different levels of access.
